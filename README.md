# Overview
This is a small project to have a reference for implementing a mock for an ES6 module dependency in a Jest test. In `sound-player-consumer.test.ts` the SoundPlayer import is being mocked, then in the test an implementation is provided. In this simple example `console.log` statements are used to verify that the mock is being called.
